## Scope of this Article

Machine learning is a large field, and being a superset of deep learning, it has greatly expanded in the recent years.

Documenting the complete area of machine would be far beyond the scope of this doc. file. Instead, here we would like to go over the most basic and fundamental concepts that define machine learning. Those concepts are broadly discussed in the context of our system, but are not limited to neural networks.

## A Definition

Tom Mitchell in his book 'Machine Learning' defines it in this manner[^1]:

> A computer program is said to learn from `experience E` with respect to some class of `tasks T` and `performance measure P`, _if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E_.
