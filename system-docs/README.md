# Documentation

These are the system docs. All kinds of documentation will be stored here, arranged into folders.

  - [Guidelines](#guidelines)


## Guidelines

1. Each file must be a markdown file. Extended markdown is supported.
2. Each file must have a table of contents, like this file's.
3. Each file must be to-the-point and may appropriately refer other files as and when appropriate, via internal links. (For now, just ensure the linking works on github.)
